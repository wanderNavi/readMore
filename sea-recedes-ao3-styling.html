	<p>There’s no one to tell Chrom what happened: what smashed trees and buildings to matchsticks, what crumbled the stone to dusty pebbles, what burned shadows onto the ground with a killing light. He sees, from far, far away, the flattened earth, the extinguished fires, the – obliteration. Annihilation.</p>
	<p>Cautiously, he draws closer, and thinks he’s imagining the faint taste of magic sticking to the roof of his mouth. He takes a swig of water to chase away the metallic taste. As he approaches the blackened earth of the vast crater at the center, he fails to find bodies.</p>

	<div style="color:#595959;">
		<p style="margin-left: 10%;margin-right: 10%">Underneath the silence, the earth and air hums immortal, a vibration in the bones of the ground, shifting by the inches and fractions of inches, the transmutation of stones in a cauldron of heat, an ageless cycle without a mind for the living on its surface or the dead trapped within its layers. Long ago the mountains rose and far into the future the mountains will rise. Tension mounts along the cracks, teeth upon the miles-long waves.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 10%;margin-right: 10%">He lies on his back on the smooth surface of a great gray slab of rock, dust in his hair and under his fingertips, the sun shining red through his closed eyelids, a light wind carrying the scent of new flowers. His heart beats, a slow thrum, in his chest and up his neck and down his wrists and ankles, in the shells of his ears and the curves of his skull; he can hear it beating unhurried and unaware of the time it marks with each rebounding thump, mindful only of the blood passing through his arteries and veins and diffusing through his capillaries and entangling in his lungs, unfailingly beating its drum.</p>

	<p>Their footsteps continue forward, hugging the forest edge. Chrom pushes his way past needles and half hidden eddies and slopes. The forest’s boundaries twist and curve, each shadow only growing longer and deeper as the sun swiftly sinks into the earth. He runs through the shadowed shawl of night pulling across the land in silken star-studded folds of abyssal blue. He runs and he – <i><small>why is he doing this, why is he stretching his fingertips to the farthest he can reach,</small> like if he just stretches a little harder, he can reach past the limits of his skeleton and grasp a hand already turned away, <big>that had never</big></i> – and he runs.</p>

		<p style="margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%">Just because Chrom doesn’t have to sleep, doesn’t mean he completely abstains. He climbs the trees that grow thick and strong from the carved-out hollows of what once were cellars and home foundations, only identifiable now by the stones he lays his hands on, too smooth and in off-color blocks. Birds and squirrels settle around him quizzically, watching him lash himself onto a suitable branch. He closes his eyes.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15%;margin-right: 15%">There are insects and frogs, the vibration of sound rising into the moist air. The water in the clouds above shiver as they roil and rub together in response to the wind’s insistent pushing. In the air: the smell of cedar, the fragrance of plum blossoms, the ozone of a storm oncoming. He breathes in, with all of time unrolling before him in its wide, lazing current. The world remains an indominable monument.</p>
